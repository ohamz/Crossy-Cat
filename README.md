# Crossy Cat

## Name
We chose to name our project "Crossy Cat", since our game is inspired by the arcade game "Crossy Road"

## Description
In this game, you are a cat that has to cross the infinite map, avoiding trucks, cars and trains for as long as possible. You can customize your cat (either orange, black, grey or white), and use the arrows, touchpad or "A" key to go up on the map.
Try to beat your own highscore !
